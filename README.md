# skiff-email-parser
Parse all your old emails to find the senders

## How it Works 
You  just have to add all the data you got from the skiif download and either copy it to the current emails.txt
or just change the file to emails.txt and add it to the project

## Where does it go
It is inside of your names.txt file in the project so you can see it there
